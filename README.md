## 📌 Project Description

This API powers subscription-based platforms, offering authentication, user management, and automated billing workflows. It enhances security with **JWT authentication**, prevents abuse with **rate limiting**, and automates reminders using **Upstash Redis**.

## ❗ The Problem We Are Solving

Managing subscriptions manually is inefficient and error-prone. Businesses need an automated, scalable, and secure solution to handle user sign-ups, payments, renewals, and cancellations while preventing fraud.

## 🔍 What Our Project Is

A **Node.js & Express.js**-based API with **MongoDB** for data persistence, ensuring **real-time subscription tracking, email notifications, and robust access control** for businesses handling recurring payments.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **User Authentication:** Secure sign-up, login, and JWT-based authorization.
2. **Subscription Plans:** Define and manage multiple pricing tiers.
3. **Automated Workflows:** Scheduled reminders, payment retries, and expiration alerts.
4. **Security Features:** Rate limiting, bot protection, and API access controls.
