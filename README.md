## 📌 Project Description

The **Pay Flow - Subscription Management System API** is a scalable, production-ready backend solution designed to manage real users, subscriptions, and transactions securely. With robust authentication, automated workflows, and seamless integration capabilities, it ensures efficient and secure subscription management for businesses of all sizes.

### ❗ The Problem We Are Solving

Managing subscriptions manually is inefficient and error-prone. Businesses need an automated, scalable, and secure solution to handle user sign-ups, payments, renewals, and cancellations while preventing fraud.

### 🔍 What Our Project Is

A **Node.js & Express.js**-based API with **MongoDB** for data persistence, ensuring **real-time subscription tracking, email notifications, and robust access control** for businesses handling recurring payments.

### ⚙️ How It Works

1. **User Authentication:** Secure sign-up, login, and JWT-based authorization.
2. **Subscription Plans:** Define and manage multiple pricing tiers.
3. **Automated Workflows:** Scheduled reminders, payment retries, and expiration alerts.
4. **Security Features:** Rate limiting, bot protection, and API access controls.

## 📅 Project Timeline

### ✅ Initial Stage

- Designed the database schema and authentication flow.
- Integrated JWT authentication and role-based access control.

### 🚧 Current Stage

- Implementing **automated email reminders and workflow triggers** using Upstash.
- Enhancing security with **Arcjet for bot protection**.

### 🔮 Future Stage

- Integrating **Stripe for seamless payments**.
- Expanding to support **GraphQL** for more flexible API queries.
- Adding **unit and integration testing** for higher reliability.

---

## 🏆 Progress and Experience

### 💭 Process

- **Research & Planning:** Analyzed common subscription models.
- **Implementation:** Built secure authentication, user CRUD, and subscription plans.
- **Testing & Optimization:** Added middleware for global error handling and logging.

### 📚 Learnings

Through this project, we learned:

- API security best practices (**JWT, rate limiting, bot protection**).
- Efficient database design using **MongoDB & Mongoose**.
- Deploying scalable **Node.js applications** on **VPS hosting**.

### 🚀 Improvement

While we've made significant progress, there's always room for improvement:

- **Enhanced Payment Support:** Implementing **Stripe for seamless transactions**.
- **GraphQL API:** Providing **flexible data querying options**.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Adding **unit & integration tests** for higher stability.

## 🎯 Hackathon Participation

### 📅 Event Details

We participated in **FOSS Hack 2025**, India's largest open-source hackathon, held from **February 22-23, 2025**. The event focused on building or extending free and open-source software projects, offering a prize pool of **₹5,00,000**.

However, due to our internship commitments, we couldn't focus on the project as much as we wanted. We will continue developing it and provide updates as soon as possible.

### 📜 Hackathon Rules

- Projects must be open-source and licensed under a valid FOSS license.
- No external APIs should serve as the core feature.
- Evaluation is based on code commits during the event.
- No blockchain, web3, or crypto projects are allowed.
- Cash prizes are awarded at the jury's discretion.
