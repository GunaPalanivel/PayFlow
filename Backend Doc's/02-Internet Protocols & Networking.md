## 1. Internet Protocols & Networking

### 1.1 HTTP and HTTPS

HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) governs communication between clients and servers. HTTPS is the secure version, encrypting data for added protection.

### 1.2 DNS (Domain Name System)

DNS translates human-readable domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses, much like an internet phone book.

### 1.3 IP Addresses

IP (Internet Protocol) addresses uniquely identify devices on the internet.

- **IPv4:** Standard format (e.g., 192.168.1.1) but limited.
- **IPv6:** A newer format designed for an expanding internet.
