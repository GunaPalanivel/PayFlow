## **1. Backend Architectures: Structuring Your Application**

### **1.1 What is Backend Architecture?**

Backend architecture defines the **design and structure** of an applicationâ€™s backend components. Choosing the right architecture is crucial for **scalability, maintainability, and performance.**

### **1.2 Types of Backend Architectures**

#### **2.2.1 Monolithic Architecture**

- **All components (user authentication, database, business logic) are within a single codebase.**
- **Pros:**
  - Simple development and deployment.
  - Easier debugging and testing.
- **Cons:**
  - Difficult to scale.
  - Can become complex as the app grows.

#### **2.2.2 Microservices Architecture**

- **Application is broken into independent services, each handling a specific function (e.g., authentication, payments, notifications).**
- **Services communicate via APIs.**
- **Pros:**
  - Highly scalable.
  - Each service can be updated independently.
- **Cons:**
  - More complex setup.
  - Requires API management between services.

#### **2.2.3 Serverless Architecture**

- **Backend logic is executed in cloud-based functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Vercel, Firebase Functions).**
- **No need to manage servers manually.**
- **Pros:**
  - Cost-efficient (pay only for execution time).
  - Auto-scalable.
- **Cons:**
  - Limited execution time per function.
  - Cold starts may introduce latency.

### **2.3 Choosing the Right Architecture**

| Architecture      | Best For                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Monolithic**    | Small to medium-sized applications with simpler logic.        |
| **Microservices** | Large-scale applications needing flexibility and scalability. |
| **Serverless**    | Startups, event-driven applications, and rapid development.   |

## **3. Summary and Next Steps**

### **3.1 Key Takeaways**

- **Databases** store, manage, and organize data, categorized into **SQL (structured)** and **NoSQL (flexible, unstructured).**
- **SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL) are best for structured relationships,** while **NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis) is best for flexible, large-scale data.**
- **Backend architectures** determine how applications are structured:
  - **Monolithic:** Simple but harder to scale.
  - **Microservices:** Flexible and scalable but complex.
  - **Serverless:** Auto-scalable but execution-time limited.
- **Using ORMs like Prisma, Sequelize, and Mongoose simplifies database interactions.**

### **3.2 Whatâ€™s Next?**

Now that you understand databases and backend architectures, it's time to apply this knowledge. The next step is to build a **real-world subscription tracking API** using:

- **Node.js & Express (backend framework).**
- **MongoDB (NoSQL database).**
- **Authentication using JWT.**
- **Automation with Upstash Workflows.**

By implementing these concepts, you'll gain hands-on experience in **database integration, API development, and scalable backend architecture.** Stay tuned for the practical implementation!
