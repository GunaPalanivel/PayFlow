# Subscription Tracker API - Backend Documentation

## Introduction

Every time platforms like Netflix, Spotify, or Amazon go down, they lose millions per minute. What prevents such failures? A robust backend system. While sleek frontends capture attention, the backend ensures smooth functionality, handling data, security, and performance.

This guide covers backend development fundamentals, from understanding server concepts to building a production-grade **subscription management system** with real users, payments, and business logic.

## 1. What is Backend Development?

Backend development involves building and maintaining server-side logic, database management, authentication, and API interactions that power web and mobile applications. It ensures smooth communication between the frontend and database, processing data and managing users.

### 1.1 Frontend vs Backend

- **Frontend**: User-facing interface built using frameworks like React, Next.js, and HTML/CSS.
- **Backend**: Handles business logic, data processing, and database interactions.

A **server** is a machine storing backend code, processing requests, and sending data to the frontend. Servers can be hosted on AWS, DigitalOcean, or VPS platforms.

### 1.2 Client-Server Model

1. **Client (User Device):** Sends an HTTP request (e.g., searching Google, logging in).
2. **Server:** Processes the request, retrieves/stores data, and prepares a response.
3. **Response:** Server sends data back to the client.

This interaction happens in milliseconds, enabling real-time communication.

## 2. Internet Protocols & Networking

### 2.1 HTTP & HTTPS

- **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):** Governs communication between clients and servers.
- **HTTPS:** Encrypts data for security.

### 2.2 DNS (Domain Name System)

- Translates human-readable domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses.

### 2.3 IP Addresses

- **IPv4:** Standard format (e.g., 192.168.1.1), limited in availability.
- **IPv6:** A newer format designed for the expanding internet.

## 3. APIs and Communication

### 3.1 What is an API?

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) enable communication between frontend and backend systems. They act as messengers that allow seamless data exchange.

### 3.2 CRUD Operations

- **GET:** Retrieve data.
- **POST:** Create new data.
- **PUT/PATCH:** Update existing data.
- **DELETE:** Remove data.

### 3.3 Types of APIs

- **RESTful APIs:** Rely on HTTP methods and stateless architecture.
- **GraphQL:** Allows clients to request only required data, optimizing performance.

## 4. Backend Languages and Frameworks

### 4.1 Popular Backend Languages

- **JavaScript (Node.js, Bun, Deno)** - Lightweight, widely used.
- **Python (Django, Flask)** - Simplicity and readability.
- **Java (Spring Boot)** - Enterprise-grade applications.
- **Ruby (Ruby on Rails)** - Developer-friendly syntax.

### 4.2 Backend Frameworks

- **Express.js** - Lightweight and fast (Node.js).
- **NestJS** - Modular and scalable.
- **Django** - Secure and fast development (Python).
- **Spring Boot** - Enterprise solutions (Java).

## 5. Databases and Storage

### 5.1 Types of Databases

- **Relational Databases (SQL)**: Structured, uses tables (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
- **NoSQL Databases**: Flexible, stores unstructured data (e.g., MongoDB, Firebase).

### 5.2 Security Measures

- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT-based user verification.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse by limiting requests.
- **Bot Protection**: Prevents automated attacks.
- **Error Handling & Logging**: Ensures smooth debugging.

### 5.3 ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)

- **Prisma, Sequelize (SQL)**
- **Mongoose (NoSQL)**

## 6. Backend Architectures

### 6.1 Types of Architectures

| Architecture      | Best For                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Monolithic**    | Small to medium applications, simpler logic.                  |
| **Microservices** | Large-scale applications needing flexibility and scalability. |
| **Serverless**    | Startups, event-driven applications, rapid development.       |

### 6.2 Choosing the Right Architecture

- **Monolithic:** Simple but harder to scale.
- **Microservices:** Flexible and scalable but complex.
- **Serverless:** Auto-scalable but execution-time limited.

## 7. Setup and Development

### 7.1 Development Tools

- **HTTPie:** API testing tool, alternative to Postman.
- **Node.js & Express.js:** Backend framework.

### 7.2 API Endpoints

#### Root Endpoint

- `GET /` → Returns `Welcome to the Subscription Tracker API`.

#### User Management

- `POST /api/v1/signup` → Registers a user (returns JWT token).
- `GET /api/v1/users/{id}` → Retrieves user data (authentication required).
- `GET /api/v1/users` → Retrieves all users (admin access required).

#### Subscription Management

- `POST /api/v1/subscriptions` → Creates a new subscription.
- Auto-calculates `renewal_date` based on `start_date` and `frequency`.

### 7.3 Security & Performance

- **Rate Limiting (Arcjet):** Prevents excessive requests.
- **JWT Authentication:** Secure API access.
- **Bot Protection:** Blocks spam requests.

### 7.4 Automated Workflows & Email Notifications

- **Subscription Reminders:** Auto-email before renewal date.
- **Upstash Workflows:** Automates background tasks.

### 7.5 Deployment & VPS Hosting

- **Why Use a VPS?**
  - **Full control** over server configurations.
  - **Better performance** than shared hosting.
  - **Real-world skills** in server management and deployment.
