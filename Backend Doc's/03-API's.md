## 1. APIs: The Backbone of Communication

### 1.1 What is an API?

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) act as messengers between frontend clients and backend servers. They allow seamless data exchange, similar to how waiters relay orders in a restaurant.

### 1.2 CRUD Operations

APIs manage resources using CRUD operations:

- **GET** - Retrieve data (e.g., fetching user profiles).
- **POST** - Create new data (e.g., signing up a user).
- **PUT/PATCH** - Update existing data.
- **DELETE** - Remove data.

### 1.3 API Components

- **Endpoints:** URLs representing resources (e.g., `/users` for user data).
- **Headers:** Metadata (e.g., authentication tokens).
- **Request Body:** Data sent in POST/PUT requests.
- **Response Body:** Data returned by the server.
- **Status Codes:** Indicate success or failure (e.g., `200 OK`, `404 Not Found`).

## 2. Types of APIs

### 2.1 RESTful APIs

REST (Representational State Transfer) is the most widely used API style. It relies on HTTP methods are often called "HTTP verbs" and stateless architecture, meaning each request is independent.

### 2.2 GraphQL

GraphQL, developed by Facebook, provides flexibility by allowing clients to request only the needed data, optimizing performance for complex applications.
